|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source Code**      | **Open-source**: The source code is freely available for modification and distribution. Driven by community contributions, it fosters transparency and adaptability. | **Proprietary**: Source code is owned and controlled by Microsoft. It is closed to public modification, ensuring consistent and controlled development. |
| **User Interface**   | **Desktop Environments**: Offers a variety of environments such as GNOME, KDE, XFCE, and LXDE, allowing extensive customization and choice. | **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Features a consistent design with taskbars, start menus, and windows. Windows 10 and 11 provide a more unified experience compared to earlier versions. |
| **File Systems**     | **Ext4**: Journaling file system with support for large files and partitions. Provides good performance and reliability. <br> **XFS**: High-performance file system, suitable for large data volumes and high-speed operations. <br> **Btrfs**: Advanced file system with features like snapshots, subvolumes, and integrated RAID support. | **NTFS**: The primary file system with advanced features like journaling, permissions, encryption, and large file support. <br> **FAT32**: Older file system with limitations on file and partition sizes. <br> **exFAT**: Designed for flash drives and SD cards, supporting large files and volumes. |
| **Package Management**| **Advanced Package Managers**: Tools like `apt`, `yum`, and `dnf` are used for installing, updating, and managing software. Provides extensive repositories and dependency management. | **Windows Store**: A digital distribution platform for applications. <br> **Windows Installer**: Uses `.msi` files for software installation. <br> **Package Managers**: Tools like [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and [winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) for command-line based software management. |
| **Command Line**     | **Powerful**: Rich set of tools and commands for various administrative tasks. Commonly used commands include `ls`, `grep`, `awk`, and `sed`. Offers advanced scripting capabilities with Bash and other shells. | **Command Prompt & PowerShell**: Command Prompt provides basic command-line capabilities, while PowerShell offers a more advanced scripting environment with cmdlets and automation features. |
| **Multitasking**     | **Effective**: Utilizes task managers like `htop` and `top` for process monitoring. Supports multitasking with efficient resource management and process scheduling. | **Integrated Task Manager**: Provides a graphical interface for monitoring processes, performance, and resource usage. Includes features like process prioritization and memory management. |
| **Security**         | **Advanced Security Features**: Includes customizable security settings, SELinux, AppArmor, and robust permission management. Community-driven updates and patches enhance security. | **Built-in Security Tools**: Includes Windows Defender for antivirus protection, User Account Control (UAC) for permission management, and Windows Firewall for network protection. Security updates are regularly provided by Microsoft. |
| **Customization**    | **Highly Customizable**: Extensive options for customizing desktop environments, window managers, and system behaviors. Users can modify almost every aspect of the system. | **Limited Customization**: Customization options are more controlled and standardized. Users can modify themes, settings, and some interface elements, but core system functions are less flexible. |
